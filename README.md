# Solar Plexus

## Overview

This project aims to simplify the process of scheduling solar panel evaluations for Los Angeles residents and city hall employees. The application will support two user roles: Residents, who can submit appointment requests, and City Hall Employees, who can manage and optimize these requests for evaluation specialists. By streamlining the scheduling process, this app supports the city’s initiative to combat global warming by encouraging solar panel installation.

## Features
This project includes:

	1.	Address Filtering by ZIP Code
	•	Residents can enter their ZIP code to filter and validate their address from the provided Los Angeles address dataset.
	•	Autocomplete functionality can narrow down addresses based on partial input or ZIP code.
	2.	Request Management
	•	Take Requests: Residents can submit appointment requests via the form.
	•	Confirm Requests: City hall employees can review pending requests and confirm appointments based on availability and proximity.
	•	Mark as Complete: Once an evaluation is conducted, employees can update the status of the appointment to “Completed.”
	3.	Printable Address List
	•	City hall employees can generate and print a list of confirmed appointments, including the resident’s name, contact details, and address, for use by specialists during visits.
	4.	Sorting Functionality
	•	Admins can sort appointments dynamically based on:
	•	Name: Alphabetical order by resident name.
	•	Date & Time: Chronological order of appointment times.
	•	Address: Grouped by street or ZIP code to minimize travel time.

These features enhance usability, improve efficiency, and ensure a seamless experience for both residents and city employees.
